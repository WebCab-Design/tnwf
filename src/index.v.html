			<p>The Tucson Nurses Week Foundation began in July 1994 when a group of Tucson nurse leaders came together to pursue a vision for a citywide celebration of Nurses Week. The goals of the Foundation and the Nurses Week events are to enhance education and research among Tucson-area Nurses and to celebrate excellence by recognizing Nurses in a manner commensurate with the roles Nurses play in the health of the community. This recognition process seeks Nurses in all settings and all types of Nursing practice. In the past, it was rare for the general public to hear about the accomplishments of Nurses who are responding daily to the health-care needs of the Tucson community.</p>

			<p>The Tucson Nurses Week Foundation is a nonprofit, 501©(3) organization. The Foundation is committed to SHARING innovative health-care practices, to humanistic CARING for the community, and to CELEBRATING Nursing as a learning profession.</p>
