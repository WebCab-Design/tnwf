			<h3>Fabulous 50</h3>
			<p>During annual Tucson Nurses Week events, the Foundation recognizes, publicizes, and supports the accomplishments, innovations, and contributions of Nurses to the health of our community. The Foundationâ€™s emphasis is on ALL Nurses as each provides the day-to-day health care to the citizens of Tucson.</p>

			<p>Fifty of these outstanding Nurses are honored annually. The first group of Fabulous Fifty Nurses was honored in 1995. Each year, with the support and leadership of the American Nurses Association, one week is set aside to recognize and celebrate Nurses across the country.</p>
