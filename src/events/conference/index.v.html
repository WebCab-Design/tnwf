	<h1>Conference and Healthy Fair</h1>

	<p>The Showcase of Tucson Nurses is a sharing educational conference where southern Arizona Nurses exchange innovative health care ideas during a two-part continuing education offering.</p>
	<p>As a part of the Nurses Week Celebration, this program is a tribute to southern Arizona Nurses who respond daily to the health care needs of the community.</p>
	<p>Annually more than two hundred Nurses from southern Arizona, educators, staff Nurses, administrators, clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, researchers, and other practicing professionals from a variety of disciplines, attend the Showcase to learn about current Nursing research and practice, and network with their colleagues.</p>
	<p>The focus of the Healthy Fair and Conference is to encourage Nurses to explore and experience varied ways of caring for themselves and their own families through education and other modalities. It is also an opportunity for Nurses to share special interests with their peers through arts, self-care, and products. Vendors often display jewelry, uniforms, drug information, vaccine information, scholarly publications, massage therapy, and many other interesting, informative, and fun exhibits for Nurses during the annual conference.</p>
